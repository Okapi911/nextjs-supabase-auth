This is a Supabase x Next Js project which I use to practice cybersecurity on webpages.
It was initially forked from a simple Supabase authentification page tutorial because I had trouble 
setting up dependencies to make it work on my own (it was my first time working with the modern version of next js using app/page.js structure).
